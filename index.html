              As a scholar of Comparative Politics and American Politics, my
              primary area of specialization is democratic studies, with a
              particular focus on the topics at the intersection of historical
              processes of (de)democratization and racial inclusion/exclusion. I
              explore these issues through a comparative and historical lens,
              with a regional emphasis on the United States and Western Europe.
              I am also interested in developing qualitative methods of
              political science, particularly discourse analysis, case study
              research, and Comparative Historical Analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
              I completed my Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of
              Massachusetts Amherst under the guidance of Amel Ahmed, Jesse
              Rhodes, and Erik Bleich. My dissertation, titled Regime Contention
              and Racial Enfranchisement in the United States: From the
              Progressive Era to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, explores why
              there was no reform of racial enfranchisement—suffrage extension
              to racial minorities—during the Progressive Era despite several
              conducive factors, and why such a reform eventually occurred with
              the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I have presented my
              research at the annual conferences of NPSA, NYSPSA, ISA, MPSA, and
              APSA, and currently have a co-authored piece under review. I have
              also taught undergraduate courses on Race and American Politics
              and Introduction to Comparative Politics.

              <strong>Video Description:</strong> In 2023, my close friend Ozkan
              Yildiz and I created a digital storytelling video that contrasts
              the personal journeys of my sister and me, which began under
              similar circumstances but diverged due to the availability—or lack
              thereof—of accessibility-enhancing technologies. This project
              received financial and technical support from the Instructional
              Media Lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and was
              featured at the 2023 Flexible Learning Summit organized by the
              university.

              One of the most important decisions in life is choosing a career
              path and I have experienced a special journey before making this
              decision. My elder sister and I are both visually impaired
              individuals. She was a very industrious person who graduated from
              the most prestigious law school in Turkey as valedictorian.
              Contrary to her initial expectations, however, all of her
              applications for important positions both in bureaucracy and
              private sector were rejected due to her disability. The only
              available job opportunities were those that assume no genuine
              responsibility. It was my first cold confrontation with this
              institutionalized bias against physically impaired individuals.
              This incident occurred in the earlier days of my high school
              education and I felt that I was in the verge of deciding which way
              to go for the rest of my life: Whether I was to acquiescence to
              the confinements imposed on me and contend with an isolated life
              style, or I was to transcend the boundaries and strive hard to
              become a success story.
            </p>
            <p>
              I chose the second path and have since dedicated myself to two
              primary goals. First, I sought a career where I could make a
              meaningful impact as an independent individual. Second, and
              perhaps more importantly, I aimed to challenge the common
              prejudices surrounding my disability. Academia seemed like the
              ideal avenue to achieve both goals for two key reasons—though,
              unfortunately, I now have serious doubts about these assumptions.
              First, I believed that success in academia was based almost
              entirely on one's intellectual abilities, not physical
              limitations, in a field that values objectivity and creativity
              above all else. Second, academia’s channels of knowledge—through
              books, lectures, conferences, and media—are accessible to all who
              wish to engage with and contribute to them. These reasons
              convinced me that my future belonged in the academic world, where
              I could do what I do best and, ideally, be valued solely for my
              contributions.
            </p>
            <p>
              After graduating from high school as valedictorian, I took the
              National University Entrance Exam in 2008 and ranked 23rd out of
              approximately 1.7 million students. This was the highest score
              ever achieved by a disabled student in the exam’s nearly
              fifty-year history. As a result, I was accepted into the Business
              Administration program at TOBB University of Economics and
              Technology (UET), one of the top schools for finance with a
              reputation for academic excellence. However, while the program was
              prestigious, it didn’t fully ignite my intellectual passions. I
              had always been deeply interested in both domestic and global
              politics, and fortunately, UET offered high-performing students
              the opportunity to pursue a double major. Choosing to add
              International Relations (IR) to my studies was a turning point in
              my life.
            </p>
            <p>
              From my very first courses in the International Relations (IR)
              department, I was captivated by its diverse focus. I found
              particular interest in International Relations theory,
              international political economy (IPE), globalization, and the role
              of non-state actors. After a few semesters, I sought to combine my
              two academic tracks—applying my financial and statistical
              knowledge to the literature of IR—and develop as a student capable
              of conducting both qualitative and quantitative research. This
              diverse curriculum inspired me to pursue an interdisciplinary
              approach, focusing especially on IPE. Upon graduating with dual
              majors in Business Administration and International Relations from
              TOBB UET, with GPAs of 4.00/4.00 and 3.56/4.00 respectively, and
              as valedictorian, I began my MA in Political Science and
              International Relations at Koç University, home to one of Turkey’s
              few graduate programs with a specific emphasis on IPE. At Koc
              University, I had the privilege to work as a teaching and research
              assistant for Ziya Onis and Bahar Rumelili and I wrote my MA
              thesis on the rethinking of global hegemony in light of the recent
              rise of China under their mentorship along with Hakan Ovunc Ongur.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although I began my Ph.D. at the University of Massachusetts
              Amherst in 2015 with a focus on international political economy
              (IPE) and international relations theory, my academic trajectory
              evolved significantly due to my exposure to a broader curriculum,
              a new culture, and diverse life experiences. Interacting with
              individuals from various backgrounds and life paths expanded my
              interpretive lens, reshaping how I understood both my personal
              story and scholarly identity. Previously, I saw my experience of
              marginalization as rooted solely in my physical differences, and I
              aimed to overcome this by excelling within the majority's
              meritocratic framework, viewing it as a story of personal triumph.
              However, my encounters with others who faced exclusion based on
              ascriptive identities illuminated broader social boundaries, even
              within so-called established democracies. This realization
              compelled me to critically examine the relationship between
              democratic governance and demographic diversity during my Ph.D.
              studies.
