              As a scholar of Comparative Politics and American Politics, my
              primary area of specialization is democratic studies, with a
              particular focus on the topics at the intersection of historical
              processes of (de)democratization and racial inclusion/exclusion. I
              explore these issues through a comparative and historical lens,
              with a regional emphasis on the United States and Western Europe.
              I am also interested in developing qualitative methods of
              political science, particularly discourse analysis, case study
              research, and Comparative Historical Analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
              I completed my Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of
              Massachusetts Amherst under the guidance of Amel Ahmed, Jesse
              Rhodes, and Erik Bleich. My dissertation, titled Regime Contention
              and Racial Enfranchisement in the United States: From the
              Progressive Era to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, explores why
              there was no reform of racial enfranchisement—suffrage extension
              to racial minorities—during the Progressive Era despite several
              conducive factors, and why such a reform eventually occurred with
              the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I have presented my
              research at the annual conferences of NPSA, NYSPSA, ISA, MPSA, and
              APSA, and currently have a co-authored piece under review. I have
              also taught undergraduate courses on Race and American Politics
              and Introduction to Comparative Politics.

              <strong>Video Description:</strong> In 2023, my close friend Ozkan
              Yildiz and I created a digital storytelling video that contrasts
              the personal journeys of my sister and me, which began under
              similar circumstances but diverged due to the availability—or lack
              thereof—of accessibility-enhancing technologies. This project
              received financial and technical support from the Instructional
              Media Lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and was
              featured at the 2023 Flexible Learning Summit organized by the
              university.
