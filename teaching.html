      <h1>Teaching</h1>
      <p>
        In 2024, I was honored to be a finalist for the Distinguished Teaching
        Award at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, which is presented
        annually to one graduate student. Over the course of my teaching career
        at Umass Amherst, I have taught "Introduction to Comparative Politics"
        for two semesters and "Race and American Politics" for one semester.
        Additionally, I have served as a teaching assistant for various courses,
        including "Introduction to American Politics,” “Introduction to
        Comparative Politics,” "Introduction to Legal Studies," "Energy Policy
        and Climate Change," "Corporate Lobbying and the Global Economy," and
        more, primarily leading weekly discussion in three sections for each
        course. Below, you will find my sample syllabi for Introduction to
        Comparative Politics and Race and American Politics, along with diverse
        evidence of my teaching effectiveness. This includes a selection of
        qualitative comments on various aspects of my teaching and support
        letters from five students advocating for my candidacy for the 2024
        Distinguished Teaching Award. The letters are anonymized but the contact
        information of the students can be shared upon request.

              This course introduces students to significant themes in
              comparative politics, designed to explore the main building blocks
              of politics across various scales of analysis. While our world is
              dominated by Western powers, nation-states, and capitalist
              institutions, these structures were not inevitable. This course
              aims to denaturalize these familiar features and uncover how our
              current political world emerged. We will begin with an unusual
              starting point: the mid-15th-century Chinese expeditions. From
              there, we will trace the evolution of politics and institutions
              across a wide geographical and temporal frame. Through comparative
              analysis, students will delve into the emergence of the modern
              state system, the roots of democratization and authoritarian
              regimes, the analysis of different institutional designs of
              government, the rise of the market economy and economic
              inequality, the birth of nations and nationalism, and the factors
              leading to ethnic conflicts and social revolutions. Throughout the
              course, we will examine these processes from the perspectives of
              holders of power on different scales and those attempting to
              counter power relations. By employing a complementary,
              comparative, historical, and ethnographic approach, students will
              gain a deeper understanding of the dynamic and complex nature of
              comparative politics.

              This course explores the complex intersections of race, ethnicity,
              and immigration, focusing on their historical and contemporary
              impacts on American political life. A central question addressed
              in the course is whether W.E.B. Du Bois' concept of the "color
              line" remains a significant issue in the evolving landscape of the
              twenty-first century. Students will engage with both foundational
              and contemporary scholarship, employing a variety of
              methodological approaches. The course will examine the definitions
              and boundaries of race and ethnicity, and it will also address key
              political science topics through the lens of race, including
              voting, representation, partisanship, identity formation,
              prejudice, and stereotypes, backlash against demographic changes,
              and social and protest movements in the United States.

              videos and presented us with new material that supplemented what
              we were learning in lecture. This made discussions very
              interesting and not just a review of what we learned in lecture.

              everyone in his discussion sections, and I feel that the
              discussion section responses required after every section helped
              provide me with material I could look back on, to remember what we
              discussed every week.

              Fatih is a wonderful person, and was always more than willing to
              help me when I reached out to him over email or in person. In
              fact, none of my TAs have gotten back to me as quickly and as
              regularly as he did. Furthermore, he is intelligent and has
              interesting thoughts.

              Beyond the classroom, Fatih is a compassionate, intelligent, and
              caring individual who has a genuine interest in my and my
              classmates’ success. He provides me with outside information and
              connects me to resources that otherwise would have been
              unavailable to me. Fatih gives thoughtful and constructive
              criticism of my work, and genuinely wants me to improve on my
              work, and provides me with the tools to do so. I was very lucky to
              have Fatih as a TA this semester, and am looking forward to see
              what he can do in semesters to come.

              What immediately sticks out about Fatih as a teacher is his desire
              to help me learn. He is always eager to help me ensure that I
              fully grasp the content that is put before me. In doing so, Fatih
              pushes me to constantly reassess and question the information that
              has been presented. Through this, he is able to provide me with a
              far deeper understanding of the material than most. In his course
              I was able to further refine my ability to look at problems
              through a critical lens, beyond just the scope of the course.

          Student Support Letters for My Nomination to 2024 Distinguished
          Teaching Award

            <p>To the Distinguished Teaching Award Review Committee,</p>
            <p>
              After hearing that one of my all-time favorite TA’s, Fatih Cetin,
              was nominated for the Distinguished Teaching Award, I'm sure you
              can imagine my delight to now have the high honor of writing a
              letter of support for Fatih. As an abstract, Fatih is, in my
              opinion, the most quintessential representation of everything an
              astounding educator should dream to embody, and everything a
              magnate university should hope to employ. Fatih boasts many
              irreplaceable qualities, and any sector of academia would be lucky
              to have him on their team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fatih was my TA for Legal 250 - Introduction to Legal Studies in
              the Spring 2023 semester, and doubtlessly, I assure you that Fatih
              is one of the principal instigators in my decision to declare
              legal studies as my major and pursue law school. One of Fatih’s
              most notable qualities is his mastery of the content pertaining to
              legal studies, the current academic field, and legal studies as it
              relates to law and society. I vividly remember Fatih's dissection
              of the Marxist philosophy of law and his emphasis on the idea that
              law is an ideological tool that codifies and provides legitimation
              to the embedded values of the dominant classes. To this day, I
              continue to readily reference Fatih’s slides and notes from his
              discussion sections in many of my classes and papers because they
              are incredibly comprehensive and easy to understand; this brings
              me to my next complement of Fatih.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fatih is influential and has an amazing power to captivate his
              audience and teach difficult content in a way that is easily
              understood by all students; it was awe-inspiring to see Fatih
              conduct his classroom in a manner which intrigued us to provide
              committed participation. One of the most valuable experiences for
              me in Fatih’s discussion sections were our exam review sessions.
              Divided into teams, Fatih encouraged learning and engagement with
              class material through legal studies Jeopardy! games in the weeks
              of our midterm and final exam. Under Fatih’s instruction, it was
              not uncommon for students to participate, ask questions, and
              aspire to learn more than just the required material for class. I
              believe the true reason we students have respect and devotion for
              Fatih, however, is not because of the value we gained from his
              class, but the personality that lies within the said instructor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fatih managed to create a learning environment where all students,
              regardless of their knowledge of the content, would raise their
              hands without fear in order to ask questions and benefit from
              class. Additionally, Fatih was always available to converse after
              class, in office hours, or through email; regardless of any
              struggle I may have incurred, Fatih was always conducive to my,
              and other students’, education. There is a certain degree of
              comfort Fatih has managed to construct within the walls of his
              classroom. To teach while truly caring for your students, their
              well-being, and their concerns can certainly be no easy task, and
              I congratulate educators like Fatih who are capable of such an
              accomplishment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through Fatih’s teaching of legal studies information, he would
              often incorporate the sentiments relating to important topics
              happening in our community, which helped us students feel seen and
              heard as participants in university—a rarity in institutionalized
              education. For example, the week Fatih was explaining the
              difference between critical race theory and feminist legal theory,
              Fatih gladly went into depth on elements of race and sexism that
              are baked into our legal system with intent to ensure dominance
              over individual actors. I was relieved and happy that this was
              fully unpacked in a class setting by Fatih without bias. In other
              classes I’ve taken, my professors have had a tendency to be
              intentionally terse on the subject matter and its social
              implications, so I was glad to have this discussion in class with
              Fatih.
            </p>
            <p>
              In an attempt to keep this letter succinct, I leave you with this.
              If your investigation into finding the winner of the Distinguished
              Teaching Award is to find the most compassionate, intelligent,
              forward-thinking educator—with enough grit and emotion to ensure
              positive change, and touch the lives of those around him at this
              university and beyond—then I implore you to look no further than
              Fatih Cetin who has personally changed my life for the better.
              Fatih has aided in the creation of my legal studies knowledge and
              guided me in my pursuit of studying law. As I journey into law
              school next year, I am glad to have had Fatih as my TA, and I know
              he will continue to inspire others.
            </p>

            <p>Dear DTA Review Committee,</p>
            <p>
              I am writing this letter of recommendation on behalf of Fatih
              Cetin for being nominated for the Distinguished Teaching Award. In
              the intricate journey of students, teaching assistants play an
              indispensable role that extends beyond mere administrative tasks.
              Their influence on student’ well-being and academic enjoyment is
              significant. Having had the privilege of being a student in
              Fatih’s class, I am confident in his ability to surpass the
              standards of excellence in teaching.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had the pleasure and honor to have Cetin as my teaching
              assistant in the fall of 2022 in the Introduction to Comparative
              Politics course as a junior at UMASS Amherst. As a student
              unfamiliar with the US system, many topics in the course were new
              to me, making it challenging at times. Initially hesitant to pose
              questions, Cetin’s adept management of the classroom created a
              professional, comfortable, and judgment-free atmosphere,
              encouraging my active participation. He exhibited unwavering
              willingness to assist, skillfully orchestrating the classroom
              environment. Fatih possesses a remarkable ability to explain
              complex concepts with clarity, making the subject matter
              accessible and comprehensible for students of various backgrounds.
              Additionally, he consistently maintained a positive demeanor to
              all the students, responded thoughtfully to questions, and
              showcased exceptional teaching abilities. When reflecting on the
              course, his warm smile while interacting with students and when
              assisting us consistently comes to my mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pivotal role of teaching involves a diverse range of skills
              and challenges, with a particular emphasis on instructing
              international students and those for whom English is a second
              language. Educating these students presents additional hurdles,
              given their potential unfamiliarity with the education system and
              the cultural disparities that may lead to varying perspectives,
              especially in a political science class. Teaching politics itself,
              often considered a new language, adds another layer of complexity
              that the classroom authority must navigate and surmount. As a
              student with English as my second language, in Fatih's classroom I
              observed not only his capability but also his comfort in
              addressing these challenges. Moreover, he exuded confidence and
              maintained a sense of control, contributing to his exceptional
              leadership during discussion sessions. In political science
              courses, where students can become impassioned and veer off-topic
              during class participation, redirecting and refocusing discussions
              require a unique set of skills, and Fatih demonstrated proficiency
              in this aspect as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              The connection forged between an instructor and students holds
              immense significance. This bond plays a pivotal role in sustaining
              student engagement, particularly when there is a positive affinity
              between the teacher and the students. When students, myself
              included, genuinely like their instructor, there is a tendency to
              invest greater effort in the class, actively participating in
              discussions and lectures. However, it is crucial that this bond,
              while friendly and conducive to students feeling at ease to ask
              questions and address challenges, maintains a professional
              demeanor. Fatih adeptly navigated this delicate balance,
              establishing a connection with students that felt both friendly
              and professional. Throughout my time in his class, I perceived him
              not just as a knowledgeable TA but also as a friend and a
              professional educator. This dual perspective fostered a
              comfortable learning environment while earning him my utmost
              regard and respect.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another remarkable quality is the genuine care that Fatih
              exhibited for the academic success and well-being of his students.
              Fatih consistently exceeded expectations by offering additional
              resources, conducting insightful review sessions, and providing
              constructive feedback on assignments. He demonstrated flexibility
              and unwavering commitment to his office hours, consistently
              displaying a deep dedication to ensuring that every student not
              only comprehended the material but also felt supported in their
              educational journey. Furthermore, in a teaching landscape where
              excellence is paramount, Fatih stands out as an exemplary educator
              who has not only overcome the challenges of visual disability but
              has transcended them to become an extraordinary instructor.
              Despite facing the unique hurdles associated with his visual
              impairment, he has not only met but surpassed the essential skills
              and qualities of a distinguished teacher. He has proven that
              visual impairment does not hinder effective teaching; on the
              contrary, it has enhanced his abilities as an educator. Through
              unwavering determination, adaptability, and an innate passion for
              teaching, Cetin has demonstrated a remarkable ability to connect
              with students, effectively convey complex concepts, and create an
              inclusive learning environment. His commitment to excellence
              serves as an inspiration, showcasing that dedication and
              competence triumph over any obstacles, making him not only a
              remarkable Teaching Assistant but one of the best in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, collaborating with Fatih made the course
              exceptionally enjoyable. I attribute my significant learning
              progress to his insightful discussion sessions and teaching
              skills, and I am confident that he will continue to positively
              impact the educational experiences of many more students. I
              recommend Fatih for any academic position that involves teaching
              and mentoring, as he not only possesses the knowledge and
              expertise in his field but also the passion and dedication to
              inspire students to excel. Cetin is not only an outstanding
              individual but also a distinguished teacher, possessing all the
              requisite skills to merit the Distinguished Teaching Award.
            </p>

            <p>Thank you for considering my recommendation.</p>

            <p>Dear members of the DTA Review Committee,</p>
            <p>
              My name is Student 3, I am currently a third-year Honors student
              at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I study Legal
              Studies & Political Science. I am writing this letter in
              unequivocal support for Faith Cetin regarding the 2024
              Distinguished Teaching Award.
            </p>
            <p>
              I first met Fatih during my second semester (Spring 2022) at
              UMass, when I was just a first-year student, when he was my
              teaching assistant for POLISCI 111:Comparative Politics. When
              Fatih introduced himself to the class and my discussion group that
              he oversaw, I immediately believed that it would be a great
              course, as he seemed approachable, intelligent, and passionate
              about both political science and ensuring that everyone in the
              class, despite its large size, was able to make their voice be
              heard.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the semester progressed, I realized that my assumptions were
              correct, as the course and the accompanying discussion section
              went smoothly for me and my fellow students under his tutelage. In
              our discussion section, we had students with different personal
              backgrounds, as well as varying interests and majors, but Fatih
              rose to the occasion to make the course engaging, fun, and
              rewarding for everyone. Specifically, Fatih would intentionally
              give space to students with less verbal dominance in the class to
              participate while facilitating deeper discussions with the class.
              Every class, I could visibly see the rigorous preparation of and
              attention to detail for class materials, including visual aids,
              discussion questions, group activities, and more. Particularly in
              regards to work ethic and passion for teaching, Fatih goes above
              and beyond, showing a level of conscious effort to pedagogy that
              is greater than some professors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking back on my course with Fatih, I can confidently say that
              his teaching and my experience in the course positively changed my
              outlook on the rest of my college career. Indeed, Fatih was able
              to connect and relate to students with ease, and I was no
              exception. Fatih both gave an abundance of constructive feedback
              on my work as well as positive feedback on exemplary work that I
              produced during that semester.
            </p>
            <p>
              Indeed, his clear dedication to facilitating my learning -
              especially in times of struggle -as well as obvious, genuine care
              to make sure that I understood the course’s difficult concepts and
              assignments made me more comfortable to participate in class, make
              learning easier, and perhaps most importantly, helped me to
              develop academic confidence as a first-year student which I have
              carried with me throughout my undergraduate career. This academic
              confidence, due in large part because of Fatih, has facilitated my
              professional success and exemplary academic performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would be remiss if I didn’t mention Faith and I’s common visual
              impairment. The perseverance and effort that Fatih displays in the
              classroom despite this disability was particularly inspiring to
              me, and I certainly look up to him and remember his words of
              wisdom when I struggle to navigate university life with my own
              visual disability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without a doubt, every educator should emulate Fatih. He
              understands the student perspective extremely well and is clearly
              invested in his students’ success and wellbeing, as he makes a
              conscious effort to build up his students through teaching,
              classroom facilitation, and mentorship in a way that is truly
              transformative.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope that the Committee sees Fatih as a transformational
              educator, just as I do. If you have any questions about me or my
              classroom experiences with Faith as an instructor, please do not
              hesitate to contact me.
            </p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>Dear DTA Review Committee,</p>
            <p>
              It is with great pleasure and happiness that I have the
              opportunity to recommend Fatih Cetin for the honor of the
              Distinguished Teaching Award. In this letter I will identify how
              Fatih’s ability to connect with all students, his approach to
              teaching, and his commitment to continuous improvement make him a
              deserving candidate for this award.
            </p>
            <p>
              To begin, I will illustrate how Fatih approaches teaching. One
              moment is particularly memorable to me. On our way to the lecture
              hall, Fatih and I happened to cross paths. Rather than say hello
              and move on, Fatih started a lively conversation. He asked about
              my experience in the course, and my thoughts on the class content,
              remembering that this was my first experience with the subject of
              Legal Studies. This simple yet meaningful interaction left a
              lasting impression, and highlights Fatih's genuine desire to
              connect with his students. In this way, Fatih is distinguished by
              his approach outside the classroom.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to taking the opportunity to connect with students,
              Fatih has consistently demonstrated an exceptional ability to
              foster a positive and enjoyable learning environment. The students
              could always count on him starting the class with a smile on his
              face and an anecdote from the weekend, or inquiries regarding what
              shows everyone has been watching recently. He created a space for
              students to start by contributing in a way where they would not be
              ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ and I think this created a good atmosphere for
              students to feel comfortable starting discussions on complex
              topics like law and legality. It was a breath of fresh air for the
              class when one time, he admitted that the weekend was spent on
              YouTube rather than assignments. His approach set a tone that
              invited students to actively participate in the class. This I feel
              is a testament to his keen observational skills and considerate
              teaching approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the height of the course we were going through many readings
              and content. I remember one particularly busy and jam packed
              discussion session, where we almost ran over time. The next
              discussion session that was already filtering in through the
              doors, and instead of brushing students' remaining questions and
              recommending to email him or to meet at another time, he gave the
              students with questions his full attention to help. It was a tough
              situation but I think the calmness and focus allowed students to
              feel far less stressed about unanswered questions so close to
              essay and exam deadlines. This unwavering support for students,
              even after a busy discussion session, demonstrates a willingness
              to provide thorough assistance despite time constraints. This
              level of dedication and aptitude in student success is a rare and
              invaluable trait in a teaching assistant.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this way, one of Fatih's notable strengths lies in his
              inclusive teaching style, catering to diverse learning needs.
              During a dynamic class where we played exam review jeopardy, he
              ensured that every student, regardless of their level of
              preparation, had the opportunity to contribute. His quick recall
              of specific chapters and units, despite being a first-time TA for
              the course, exemplifies his dedication to facilitating an
              inclusive and supportive learning experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Towards the end of the course, Fatih demonstrated what I feel is
              the most valuable trait of a teacher, and that is reflection. In
              the final week of the class Fatih sent out an email requesting the
              students assistance in filling out a reflection of how his
              discussion sessions went, and requesting input on what worked and
              what didn’t work. His sincerity shone brightly because rather than
              do this out of obligation, he followed up several times both
              before and after grades were due to get an accurate idea of how
              the course went. I have no doubt Fatih will have already taken
              this input and utilized it in his professional journey. I was and
              am deeply impressed by Fatih's commitment to continuous
              improvement and reflective teaching practices to enhance his
              professional growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Fatih Cetin for the
              Distinguished Teaching Award. His genuine connection with
              students, exceptional teaching skills, and commitment to
              continuous improvement make him a deserving candidate. Personally,
              I now find myself in the position of a Teaching Assistant, and I
              continue to use Fatih as a measure and metric to frame my approach
              inside and outside of the classroom. Ultimately, Fatih's
              contributions have undoubtedly enriched the learning environment
              for both students and fellow teaching assistants.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
            <p>Warm Regards,</p>

            <p>Dear DTA Review Committee,</p>
            <p>
              I am writing today in high support of Fatih Cetin to be considered
              for the Distinguished Teaching Award Nomination. My time as his
              student in Political Science 111 Comparative Politics has
              transformed the way I approach learning in the political and
              scientific world. As one of their students, I wanted to highlight
              their sincere impact on my academic and personal development.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Spring 2022, Not only did Fatih structure his discussions to be
              engaging, hands-on, and inclusive; he demonstrated a great ability
              to inspire and get to know his students on a personal level.
              Whether through interactive discussions, timely responses via
              email, and personal stories Fatih ensured each student had the
              ability to succeed and excel in his class. While he held office
              hours once a week, he was highly communicative and flexible,
              accommodating students who could not meet those times. Whenever I
              needed assistance with papers, he was always willing to review and
              provide detailed notes to improve my writing and arguments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the semester I frequently utilized his availability and
              timely responses to seek clarification and gain a deeper
              understanding of various topics, including but not limited to, The
              Paradox of Eurocentrism and State-Centrism, Gender Inequality
              within the Developing World, and finally the intricacies in
              conservation policies. My preferred learning method is to ask
              questions to ensure I comprehend the necessary material. Fatih was
              always well equipped with further explanations and a multitude of
              examples that always answered my questions and sparked further
              interest in the topics discussed. During our interactions, he
              effectively utilized our meetings, and I had the privilege of
              witnessing his fascination, appreciation, and passion for teaching
              students. His excitement to teach and his well thought
              explanations of difficult topics inspired me to continue pursuing
              a career in policy, with a focus on assisting low income
              communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              In lieu of a final exam, our class was instructed to write an
              essay that would focus on 1 of the 5 units covered during the
              semester. I found engaging in discussions with Fatih and his
              explanations of the concepts proved to be my most effective study
              technique. Fatih’s continuous support both on Zoom and in person,
              played a pivotal role in my academic success. His ability to
              establish personal connections with all students, providing a safe
              learning environment, and furnishing numerous resources for future
              learning significantly contributed to each student’s educational
              experience. Moreover, his willingness to share insights derived
              from his diverse life experiences in various countries greatly
              enriched the learning process of myself and others. Without these
              invaluable skills, I would not have succeeded to the extent that I
              did in the course.
            </p>
            <p>
              I strongly believe Fatih Cetin is a crucial asset to UMass Amherst
              and fully deserving of the Distinguished Teaching Award. His
              dedication to teaching, research, and service exemplifies the
              qualities of an exceptional educator. Their presence on campus and
              in their line of work is essential to the continued success and
              growth of their community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you for your time and consideration. If you have any
              questions or require additional information, please do not
              hesitate to contact me.
            </p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Student 5</p>
