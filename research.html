          Why do elites willingly bestow power upon excluded groups, thereby
          potentially reshaping the balance of power within society and
          political spheres?

            The democratization literature has grappled with these weighty
            questions since its inception as an organized field of study. While
            various explanations have been crafted to elucidate the dynamics
            surrounding working-class enfranchisement and women’s suffrage, our
            existing theories fall short of comprehensively addressing suffrage
            extensions to racialized minorities. Because racial enfranchisement
            often involves the extension of voting rights from a majority to a
            minority of the population, neither its determinants nor its
            consequences can be understood with frameworks developed to
            understand class-based extensions of the franchise from a minority
            to a majority (true for both manhood suffrage and to an extent also
            women’s suffrage). This dissertation seeks not only to carve out an
            analytical space for racial enfranchisement as both a distinct act
            of democratization and a novel concept with potentially profound
            implications for the basic concepts, focus, and assumptions of the
            democratization literature but also to study the case of the United
            States at two critical historical junctures: The Progressive Era and
            the complicity of major Republican players in the disenfranchisement
            of Black people in the Solid South, a case of failed
            enfranchisement, and the period between the 1930s and 1960s marked
            by the transformation of the Democratic Party from a staunched
            advocate of racial exclusion and suppression to the primary champion
            of a race reform, resulting with the enfranchisement of Black people
            through the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The former was marked by the
            entrenchment of a racially authoritarian regime despite the
            conducive electoral, structural, and political circumstances to the
            contrary whereas the latter saw an expansion of racial
            enfranchisement despite the absence of any clear electoral return
            and the presence of acute electoral risks for the Democrats as well
            as the existence of significant coalitions favoring racial
            exclusion. The dissertation demonstrates that racial enfranchisement
            takes place in a country under two circumstances: the emergence of
            an expansive vision of democratic peoplehood and its sway on actors
            in key governing institutions.

          No Longer the Only Game in Town? Immigration, Authoritarianism, and

          <p>
            The rise of authoritarian populist and far-right parties in
            established democracies has raised concerns about democratic
            stability in these countries. While existing research often focuses
            on electoral outcomes, we argue this approach inadequately captures
            citizens' regime preferences due to the complexities of electoral
            processes and national politics. To address this limitation, we
            adopt a democratization framework to examine the relationship
            between immigration and regime preferences across 17 Western
            democracies. Using structural equation modeling and mediation
            analysis, we find a significant positive association between
            immigrant population rates, anti-immigration attitudes, and support
            for authoritarian regimes. Our findings show that increased
            immigrant populations, interacting with individuals' latent
            authoritarian predispositions, amplify anti-immigrant sentiments,
            leading to greater endorsement of authoritarian alternatives like
            dictatorship and army rule. This research offers insights into the
            recent political landscape in Western democracies, contributing to
            debates on democratic resilience and challenges posed by changing
            demographics in Western democracies.
